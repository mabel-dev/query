# Contribution Guide

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult 
[GitHub Help](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
for more information on using pull requests.

We have included a number of tests which run automatically when code is
submitted, these tests should pass.

For consistent style, code should look like:

- Imports on separate lines (`imports` then `froms`)
- Variables should be in `snake_case`
- Classes should be in `PascalCase`
- Constants should be in `UPPER_CASE`
- Methods with docstrings
- Black formatted
- Self-explanatory method, class and variable names


Code should have:
- Corresponding unit/regression tests
- Attributed external sources - even if there is no explicit license
  requirement


A note about comments:
- Computers will interpret anything, humans need help interpreting code
- Prefer readable code over verbose comments
- Humans struggle with threading, recursion, parallelization, variables
  called `x` and more than 10... of anything
- Comments should be more than just the code in other words
- Good variable names and well-written code doesn't need comments


Check-ins should have prefixes:
- `[MBL-nnn]` items relating to Jira tickets
- `[FIX]` items fixing bugs
- `[TEST]` improvements to testing
- `[TIDY]` non-functional, commentary and cosmetic changes


Docstrings should look like:
~~~python
def sample_method(
        param_1: str,
        param_2: Optional[int] = None) -> bool:
"""
A short description of what the method does.

Parameters:
    param_1: string
        describe this parameter
    param_2: integer (optional)
        describe this parameter, if it's optional, what is the default

Returns:
    boolean
"""
